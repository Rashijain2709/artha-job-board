# 🚀 Artha Job Importer

A scalable job import system that fetches jobs from external APIs, queues them using Redis, imports them into MongoDB, and provides a UI to view import history.

---

## Features
- Fetch jobs from multiple XML-based APIs
- Queue jobs using Redis and BullMQ
- Import/update jobs in MongoDB
- Track import history (new, updated, failed)
- View import logs in a web UI
- Automated hourly job fetching (via cron)

---

## Prerequisites
- **Node.js** (v14+ recommended)
- **MongoDB** (local or cloud)
- **Redis** (local or cloud)

---

## Setup Instructions

1. **Clone the repository**
   ```sh
   git clone <your-repo-url>
   cd artha-job-board
   ```

2. **Install dependencies**
   ```sh
   npm install
   cd server && npm install
   cd ../client && npm install
   ```

3. **Configure environment variables**
   - Create a `.env` file in the `server/` directory:
     ```env
     MONGO_URI=mongodb://localhost:27017/artha-job-board
     BATCH_SIZE=5
     REDIS_HOST=localhost
     REDIS_PORT=6379
     ```

4. **Start MongoDB and Redis**
   - Make sure both services are running locally or update your `.env` for remote/cloud instances.

---

## Running the Application

### 1. Start the Backend API (with cron job)
```sh
cd server
npm start
```
- This will also schedule job fetching every hour.

### 2. Start the Worker (in a separate terminal)
```sh
cd server
node jobs/worker.js
```
- Processes queued jobs and updates import logs.

### 3. Start the Frontend
```sh
cd client
npm start
```
- Visit [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view import history.

### 4. (Optional) Manually Fetch and Enqueue Jobs
```sh
cd server
npm run fetch-and-enqueue
```

## API Feeds Used
- See `server/jobs/fetchAndEnqueue.js` for the list of job feeds.

---

## Notes
- `.env` files are gitignored for security.
- Update `MONGO_URI`, `REDIS_HOST`, and `REDIS_PORT` as needed for your environment.
- For production, consider Dockerizing MongoDB, Redis, and the app.
